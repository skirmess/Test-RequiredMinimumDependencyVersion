=head1 NAME

Test::RequiredMinimumDependencyVersion - require a minimum version for your dependencies

=head1 VERSION

Version 0.003

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Test::RequiredMinimumDependencyVersion;
    Test::RequiredMinimumDependencyVersion->new(module => { ... })->all_files_ok;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

There are some modules where you'll always depend on a minimal version,
either because of a bug or because of an API change. A good example would be
L<Test::More|Test::More> where version 0.88 introduced C<done_testing()> or
L<version|version> which strongly urges to set 0.77 as a minimum in your code.

This test can be used to check that, whenever you use these modules, you also
declare the minimum version.

This test is an author test and should not run on end-user installations.
Recommendation is to put it into your F<xt> instead of your F<t> directory.

=head1 USAGE

=head2 new( ARGS )

Returns a new C<Test::RequiredMinimumDependencyVersion> instance. C<new>
takes a hash with its arguments.

    Test::RequiredMinimumDependencyVersion->new(
        module => {
            'Test::More' => '0.88',
        },
    );

The following arguments are supported:

=head3 module (required)

The C<module> argument is a hash ref where the keys are the modules you want
to enforce and the minimal version is its value.

=head2 file_ok( FILENAME )

This will run a test for parsing the file with
L<Perl::PrereqScanner|Perl::PrereqScanner> and another test for every
C<module> you specified if it is used in this file. It is therefore unlikely
to know the exact number of tests that will run in advance. Use
C<done_testing> from L<Test::More|Test::More> if you call this test directly
instead of a C<plan>.

C<file_ok> returns something I<true> if all checked dependencies are at least
of the required minimal version and I<false> otherwise.

=head2 all_files_ok

Calls the C<all_perl_files> method of L<Test::XTFiles> to get all the files to
be tested. All files will be checked by calling C<file_ok>.

It calls C<done_testing> or C<skip_all> so you can't have already called
C<plan>.

C<all_files_ok> returns something I<true> if all files test ok and I<false>
otherwise.

Please see L<XT::Files> for how to configure the files to be checked.

WARNING: The API was changed with 0.003. Arguments to C<all_files_ok>
are now silently discarded and the method is now configured with
L<XT::Files>.

=head1 EXAMPLES

=head2 Example 1 Default usage

Check all files returned by L<XT::Files>.

    use 5.006;
    use strict;
    use warnings;

    use Test::RequiredMinimumDependencyVersion;

    Test::RequiredMinimumDependencyVersion->new(
        module => {
            'version' => '0.77',
        },
    )->all_files_ok;

=head2 Example 2 Check non-default directories or files

Use the same test file as in Example 1 and create a F<.xtfilesrc> config
file in the root directory of your distribution.

    [Dirs]
    module = lib
    module = tools
    module = corpus/hello

    [Files]
    module = corpus/my.pm

=head2 Example 3 Call C<file_ok> directly

    use 5.006;
    use strict;
    use warnings;

    use Test::More 0.88;
    use Test::RequiredMinimumDependencyVersion;

    my $trmdv = Test::RequiredMinimumDependencyVersion->new(
        module => {
            'Test::More' => '0.88',
        },
    );
    $trmdv->file_ok('t/00-load.t');
    $trmdv->file_ok('xt/author/pod-links.t');

    done_testing();
